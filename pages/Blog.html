                        <p>As a Muslim traveler, you need to plan in advance so that you are happy traveling,
                          from getting halal food to performing prayers in places where space is possible and different
                          time zones.
                          one of the beauties of Islam is the fact that it provides an alternative that facilitates all
                          of our obligatory tasks.
                          Islam alleviates difficulties while safeguarding our well-being.

                        <p>whether we are moving or staying in a place, we must not miss our prayers.</p>
                        <p>It is very important for you to plan and know when you will be traveling and prayer times
                          during your trip to your destination.
                          Always plan your prayers in advance, especially when you have a long haul flight.
                          With planning, you can roughly prepare alternatives and ways to ease your prayer.</p>
                        <p>For those who will be traveling by plane, it's time for you to use your cellphone to the
                          fullest.
                          There are tons of mobile travel apps that can help you know when to pray by simply entering
                          the time and place of your departure and destination.</p>

                        <p class="mt-5">Some of these apps provide estimated prayer times depending on your departure
                          and arrival times.
                          You can use the in-flight information screen to double-check the app-provided time.</p>

                        <h5 class="mt-2">Looking for Halal Food</h5>
                        <p>When you travel, always research Halal or Muslim-owned restaurants in the vicinity of the
                          place you plan to visit or stay at.
                          However, when there are no Halal restaurants available in the area, certified non-Halal
                          restaurants will be the next choice.</p>
                        <p>You may consider the following tips:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Check if they have halal meat options</li>
                          <li>Choose seafood or vegetarian/vegan options.</li>
                          <li>Ask not to contain alcohol in the food you choose</li>
                        </ul>
                        In some countries, generally, they will be more than happy to share materials with you!</p>

                        <h5 class="mt-2">Bathroom with water for ablution</h5>
                        <p>Prayer will not be valid if the body is impure and unclean.
                          Therefore, a bathroom with water facilities for ablution is needed by Muslim travelers.</p>
                        <p>Purifying water is also a matter of hygiene and cleanliness of the bathroom.
                          The lack of important facilities like this in tourist attractions is often complained of by
                          Muslim travelers,
                          even though they are important and needed.</p>

                          Then, ask your spouse and children what kind of tourist attractions they would like to visit.
                          In this case, you should know the various choices of tourist destinations that are child and
                          family friendly.
                          Next, discuss and determine the choice of tourist attractions, and include them in the
                          itinerary list.</p>

                        <h5 class="mt-5">Prepare Traveling Needs</h5>
                        <p>After determining where to go on vacation, then you can immediately prepare all the necessary
                          needs.
                          This is important so that later you don't get too bothered when you arrive at the location of
                          the tourist spot.
                          Moreover, if the intended destination is in an area that incidentally is less strategic.</p>
                        <p>Before preparing everything, it is important for you to know the weather conditions in the
                          main destination area.
                          The reason is, this will greatly affect the items that must be carried.
                          If the destination city is in the middle of the rainy season,
                          of course you have to prepare warm clothes, medicine, raincoats, umbrellas, and so on.
                          Likewise, if the area you are aiming for is in the middle of summer,
                          sunblock and rather light clothes must be brought.</p>
                        <p>However, try not to carry too much stuff.
                          Apart from being a hassle, this will also be very burdensome in terms of baggage fees.
                          Bring sufficient items and pack as neatly as possible.</p>

                          of choosing transportation and lodging.
                          For transportation, you must decide whether to choose the type of transportation by private
                          car, train or plane.
                          Each of course has its own advantages and disadvantages that you can adjust to the conditions.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-5">Going traveling, of course, you also have to maintain body hygiene.
                          Don't get sick just because you didn't shower while traveling. Bring toiletries such as
                          towels, toothbrushes, toothpaste and soap and wash your face.
                          You can also bring make up to keep your appearance while traveling fresh and attractive.</p>

                        <p class="mt-5">Food and drinks on the trip are the main things that you must bring.
                          If possible, bring food to eat on the way. Or you can also replace it with a snack to prop up
                          your stomach.</p>

                        <p class="mt-5">Don't forget to bring electronic devices such as cellphones, cameras and
                          chargers.
                          Do not let you run out of battery and fail to capture your traveling moments.</p>
