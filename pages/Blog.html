                      <p>As a Muslim traveler, you need to plan in advance so that you are happy traveling, 
                        from getting halal food to performing prayers in places where space is possible and different time zones.
                        one of the beauties of Islam is the fact that it provides an alternative that facilitates all of our obligatory tasks. 
                        Islam alleviates difficulties while safeguarding our well-being.

                      <h5 class="mt-2">Prayer Guide When Traveling</h5>
                      <p>whether we are moving or staying in a place, we must not miss our prayers.</p>
                      <p>It is very important for you to plan and know when you will be traveling and prayer times during your trip to your destination. 
                        Always plan your prayers in advance, especially when you have a long haul flight. 
                        With planning, you can roughly prepare alternatives and ways to ease your prayer.</p>
                      <p>For those who will be traveling by plane, it's time for you to use your cellphone to the fullest. 
                        There are tons of mobile travel apps that can help you know when to pray by simply entering the time and place of your departure and destination.</p>
                        <img src ="/assets/img/muslim-3.png" width="300px" height="100px" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
                      <p class="mt-5">Some of these apps provide estimated prayer times depending on your departure and arrival times. 
                        You can use the in-flight information screen to double-check the app-provided time.</p>

                      <h5 class="mt-2">Looking for Halal Food</h5>
                      <p>When you travel, always research Halal or Muslim-owned restaurants in the vicinity of the place you plan to visit or stay at. 
                        However, when there are no Halal restaurants available in the area, certified non-Halal restaurants will be the next choice.</p>
                      <p>You may consider the following tips:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Check if they have halal meat options</li>
                          <li>Choose seafood or vegetarian/vegan options.</li>
                          <li>Ask not to contain alcohol in the food you choose</li>
                        </ul>
                      In some countries, generally, they will be more than happy to share materials with you!</p>

                      <h5 class="mt-2">Bathroom with water for ablution</h5>
                      <p>Prayer will not be valid if the body is impure and unclean. 
                        Therefore, a bathroom with water facilities for ablution is needed by Muslim travelers.</p>
                      <p>Purifying water is also a matter of hygiene and cleanliness of the bathroom. 
                        The lack of important facilities like this in tourist attractions is often complained of by Muslim travelers, 
                        even though they are important and needed.</p>

                      <p>First, determine which city you are going on vacation to. 
                        Then, ask your spouse and children what kind of tourist attractions they would like to visit. 
                        In this case, you should know the various choices of tourist destinations that are child and family friendly. 
                        Next, discuss and determine the choice of tourist attractions, and include them in the itinerary list.</p>

                      <h5 class="mt-5">Prepare Traveling Needs</h5>
                      <p>After determining where to go on vacation, then you can immediately prepare all the necessary needs. 
                        This is important so that later you don't get too bothered when you arrive at the location of the tourist spot. 
                        Moreover, if the intended destination is in an area that incidentally is less strategic.</p>
                      <p>Before preparing everything, it is important for you to know the weather conditions in the main destination area. 
                        The reason is, this will greatly affect the items that must be carried. 
                        If the destination city is in the middle of the rainy season, 
                        of course you have to prepare warm clothes, medicine, raincoats, umbrellas, and so on. 
                        Likewise, if the area you are aiming for is in the middle of summer, 
                        sunblock and rather light clothes must be brought.</p>
                      <p>However, try not to carry too much stuff. 
                        Apart from being a hassle, this will also be very burdensome in terms of baggage fees. 
                        Bring sufficient items and pack as neatly as possible.</p>

                      <p>Planning a vacation with your family does require a lot of consideration, especially in terms of choosing transportation and lodging. 
                        For transportation, you must decide whether to choose the type of transportation by private car, train or plane. 
                        Each of course has its own advantages and disadvantages that you can adjust to the conditions.</p>
                      <p>You should be able to choose a trusted travel service so that all travel matters can run easily, smoothly, and comfortably.

                        Therefore, it is important for you to bring food in the form of your favorite snacks or snacks. 
                        For children, it can also be equipped with milk and favorite food.</p>

                        Don't forget to bring a jacket and hat to protect you from the cold and hot sun.</p>
                      <p>Bring a traveling bag that can be used to carry all your personal items and needs while traveling.</p>

                      <p class="mt-5">Before leaving, make sure you have packed various medical equipment to bring with you. 
                        Because we don't know what kind of situation we will encounter later. 
                        So it would be better to be prepared in case something unexpected happens. 
                        Bring any medicines you think you will need later.</p>
                      <p>So that you don't have to bother carrying lots of medicines, 
                        just move the medicines into a small medicine box that can be tightly closed. 
                        However, don't forget to label the name and consumption recommendations 
                        so that the drugs are not confused</p>
                      <p>If you want to travel abroad, first check with the embassy whether you 
                        can take the medicines you are taking with you. 
                        The reason is, some countries prohibit you from bringing certain drugs.</p>

                      <p class="mt-5">Traveling without an identity is certainly not recommended. 
                        Having an ID card in your bag will make you more calm and safe.</p>

                      <p class="mt-5">Bring enough cash because you don't know if the place you are going to visit has ATM outlets or digital payments. 
                        But of course you also have to bring along your ATM so you don't run out of money in the middle of the trip.</p>
                      <p>In general, in Indonesia, it is still rare to make payments such as tap cards and the like. 
                        So you have to use cash.</p>

                      <p class="mt-5">Going traveling, of course, you also have to maintain body hygiene. 
                        Don't get sick just because you didn't shower while traveling. Bring toiletries such as towels, toothbrushes, toothpaste and soap and wash your face. 
                        You can also bring make up to keep your appearance while traveling fresh and attractive.</p>

                       <p class="mt-5">Food and drinks on the trip are the main things that you must bring.
                         If possible, bring food to eat on the way. Or you can also replace it with a snack to prop up your stomach.</p>
